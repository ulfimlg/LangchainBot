friends,
I have come to the land of welfare to seek your blessings for the welfare of the nation. Welfare of the nation, welfare of the poor, I can proudly say that today this has become the main criterion in the political environment. For the first time, the country is seeing 25 crore of my poor brothers and sisters coming out of poverty. For the first time, vigorous work is going on to build pucca houses for every poor. For the first time, every household should get tap water, this campaign is reaching new heights of success. For the first time, the poor have a guarantee card for free treatment in case of illness and this government of the son of the poor has given the biggest priority to the poor. (Friends, after this I have to reach a program in Mumbai, Honorable Chief Minister also wants to be there and hence he will have to go through the middle to reach there, so I request Shinde ji to leave, I will take care of it here.) .)
friends,
Today for the first time in India we are seeing a new confidence, India is setting big goals with great courage under the inspiration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. After the formation of the government, I have worked continuously on what work has to be done and what decisions have to be taken in the first 100 days. It is not that now that the government is formed, we will roam around wearing garlands. I will work equally hard today as on 4th June. This will continue even later and hence we are moving ahead by preparing a blueprint of what to do in 100 days. And some people tell me that the issue of Modi ji's self-confidence is not of Modi's self-confidence, the issue is of the public's trust within and outside the world, but when I was in Kashi yesterday and many youths met me during the election campaign. , I see that the youth of the country have a new imagination, new ideas, they have the experience to do everything in a new way and these days I have been very impressed by the conversations I have had with them. It was not possible for me to interact with the youth, but I also want to make a personal request to the youth of the country, because the youth I have met these days have given me very good suggestions, so I would like to My vision of 100 days is that I should fix a period of 125 days and for the new 25 days that I am adding, I want the youth of my country to send me whatever thoughts come to their mind and I will sort out these. I want to include him in it by increasing it by 25 days. Because I believe that the pace with which the country is now progressing, there are new beliefs, new dreams, new resolutions every moment and hence I have full faith that the youth of the country will give me suggestions which are not normally there in our thinking, there will be newness in it. Yes, there should be new things for the future and I want that for the ideas of these youth, I have a time table of 100 days and I have an additional time table of 25 days. I am thinking in that direction, meaning that about For four months, I want to prepare such a foundation very fast, due to which my goal of 2047 starts coming closer and that is why Modi's mantra is your dreams - this is Modi's resolution and I have made your dreams my resolution. Yes, to prove that, my every moment is in your name, my every moment is in the name of the country and that is why I say 24/7 for 2047.
friends,
You tell me the height to which India has reached today in the last 10 years in the world, in the country, in every corner of the country, in every field, the new energy, new enthusiasm, new confidence and new momentum. You tell me what we have reached now. Who can take the country forward from there? Who can take it? Who can take it? Raise both your hands and tell with full force, who can take it? Who can take it?
friends,
Those people who gave false slogan of eradicating poverty for generations and used to bring garlands of opium pills in every election, and you must have seen that in every election from Nehru ji's time till 2014 elections. They used to use poverty as opium and used to chant its rosary, poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. Poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. poor.. This was the game of those people who had made corruption a etiquette, Shivaji's I want to ask you on earth, can such people lead the country? Can take the country forward? Can fulfill your dreams? Can you decide the future of your children?
friends,
I am happy that in the previous government, i.e. I am talking about the remote government, there was a brake on development in the previous government, Modi came and removed the brake, I have taken the car into top gear. Bhiwandi-Kalyan is connected to Samriddhi Highway. Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is also going to be completed very soon. Bhiwandi will also get the benefit of Vadodara-Mumbai express route. Vande Bharat trains have changed the meaning of railway travel. Metro work is going to start here very soon. Due to these development works, our textile industry here will also get a boost, new industrial possibilities will be created, employment opportunities will also increase, that is why there is a call everywhere, there is faith everywhere, there is enthusiasm everywhere and there is only one thing - again one. Once again... once again... once again... once again.
friends,
Congress can never talk about development. Congress only knows how to differentiate between Hindu and Muslim. For them, development means development only of those who vote for them. How Congress keeps on talking about Hindu-Muslim, Hindu-Muslim and I continuously expose it and when I bring out all their dishonesty, their ecosystem starts shouting that Modi has brought Hindu-Muslim, hey Modi is a Hindu. -There are people who are breaking the country in the name of Muslims, but their raw letter is being exposed. I want to give an example of this and this example is recorded in history. I challenge the Congress, if the Congress has the courage, then give an answer to my statement to the country, they will not give, their condition is like this, tell me, have you ever seen your parents or grandfather in your house, do you remember them? Do you have to open the album to do this? Remember your parents, do you remember them when you open the album? Their condition is such that to remember their parents, they have to open the album and remember them. This is the condition of people..
